# AI information truthfulness assessment (AITA)

AI generated text (analyte) →  Google search (ideal) →  Ask AI if analyte is contained in the ideal

Google extension (similar to Grammarly) or standalone website/app that allows users to select a sequence of text (or paste into a textbox) and analyze truthfulness by giving a percentage. 

## Substring
1. Take substring based on sentences (all possible sentence substrings)
1. Ask AI to summarize key facts in point form
    - link facts together (quantitative facts with dates)
Bonus: Amount of opinion

## Google search
Analyte:
- Search substrings
- Search facts linked together (who what when where why)
    - Google News
    - List of trustworthy sources
    - Provide percentage of trustworthiness
- Identify sources

## Analyte vs. Ideal
- Is the analyte contained in the ideal?
- How much of the analyte is contained in the ideal?
- How trustworthy is the source
- Weight the sources and percentage of information contained
- Ask AI to provide a percentage

## Output
- Percentage of truthfulness
- Likelihood
- Sources referenced
- How much opinion
- Summary of facts found
- How much opinions are there

## Industry solutions
- Relies on other AI checkers
- Not easily accessible to individuals (paid, standalone platform, individuals are lazy and usually want quick info)
- Length of text is limited
- Not transparent with whawt facts are checked
